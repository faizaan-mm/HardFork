Blockchain based secure fund raising and transparent spending review for election candidates.

## The Problem Today

Candidates standing in elections raise funds from well wishers to fund their campaigns. It makes sense since the candidate's initiative or party manifesto is people-driven, meaning it is meant to improve the welfare of the people.

But there are several issues with how political fundraising is done currently:
- There is no mechanism to know who are funding the political parties and how much money they are contributing. 
- Rich political donors tend to get special favours for their contributions, including unfair appointments to public posts and special tenders to their businesses after the candidates win the elections. 
- Donors having a criminal background or black money can also fund these candidates and this information remains hidden.
- It reinforces political elitism even further, maintaining the same network of politicians in power because of their affiliations to big sources of funding.

How the raised funds are appropriated is an issue. Political campaigns have many expenditures, such as the cost of travel of candidates and staff, political consulting, and the direct costs of communicating with voters via media outlets. Once a contributor transfers the money to the political candidateâ€™s account, he no longer has a say in what the funds are being utilized for. This money can be misused by the candidate for his personal benefits. 

**There is no publicly verifiable ledger to prove where the funds came from or whether the funds were appropriated properly.**

## Proposed Solution

A Decentralised application(DApp) that provides a user a secure and transparent medium to donate to a political party for campaign purposes. The app records where donor money is spent and this information can be viewed publicly to enable voters to make an informed decision while voting.

The smart contracts ensure that the amount donated by individuals is used for specific purposes as required by the party/candidate. Capital to be spent on each category of campaign expenditure is decided in advance and the option is provided to donor to choose from.

The funds which were received in the form of cryptocurrency can be used by party or candidates to make payments through the DApp. These transactions are captured in the distributed ledger. The Distributed ledger is made publicly available and provides the key statistics for the common folk to help in decision making.

This funding method will allow anyone to track the fund-raising process in real time. Any questionable sources will be quickly identified under this system.
